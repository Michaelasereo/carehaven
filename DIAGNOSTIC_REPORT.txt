=== DIAGNOSTIC REPORT ===
Date: $(date)
Issue: 500 Internal Server Error on all page routes
API Routes: Working (200 status)
Page Routes: Failing (500 status)

=== KEY FINDINGS ===
1. API routes work - server is functional
2. All page routes fail - layout/middleware issue
3. Error: EvalError in Edge Runtime middleware compilation
4. Production build works - issue is dev-specific
5. Even minimal middleware causes error

=== TEST RESULTS ===
/test: 500
/: 500
/api/debug/error: 200 ✅

=== RECOMMENDED ACTIONS ===
1. Review Next.js 15 Edge Runtime compatibility
2. Check @supabase/ssr version compatibility
3. Consider downgrading Next.js to 14.x
4. Or remove middleware and use route-level auth
